*An electrocardiogram records the electrical signals in the heart. It's a common and painless test used to detect heart problems and monitor the heart's health quickly.*

It's used  to determine or detect:
* Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
* If blocked or narrowed arteries in the heart (coronary artery disease) are causing chest pain or a heart attack
* Whether you have had a previous heart attack
* How well certain heart disease treatments, such as a pacemaker, are working
